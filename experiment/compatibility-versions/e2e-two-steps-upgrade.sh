# hack script for running a kind e2e
# must be run with a kubernetes checkout in $PWD (IE from the checkout)
# Usage: SKIP="ginkgo skip regex" FOCUS="ginkgo focus regex" kind-e2e.sh

set -o errexit -o nounset -o xtrace

# Settings:
# SKIP: ginkgo skip regex
# FOCUS: ginkgo focus regex
# LABEL_FILTER: ginkgo label query for selecting tests (see "Spec Labels" in https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#filtering-specs)
#
# The default is to focus on conformance tests. Serial tests get skipped when
# parallel testing is enabled. Using LABEL_FILTER instead of combining SKIP and
# FOCUS is recommended (more expressive, easier to read than regexp).
#
# GA_ONLY: true  - limit to GA APIs/features as much as possible
#          false - (default) APIs and features left at defaults
# FEATURE_GATES:
#          JSON or YAML encoding of a string/bool map: {"FeatureGateA": true, "FeatureGateB": false}
#          Enables or disables feature gates in the entire cluster.
#          Cannot be used when GA_ONLY=true.
# RUNTIME_CONFIG:
#          JSON or YAML encoding of a string/string (!) map: {"apia.example.com/v1alpha1": "true", "apib.example.com/v1beta1": "false"}
#          Enables API groups in the apiserver via --runtime-config.
#          Cannot be used when GA_ONLY=true.
