# Contributing to kubernetes/test-infra

Welcome! If you haven't seen them already, the Kubernetes project has:

- A [Contributor Guide][contrib-guide] - some [kubernetes/kubernetes]-specific content, but lots of info for the entire project
- A [Contributor Cheat Sheet][contrib-cheatsheet] - lots of resources and handy links

## Contact

This repo is owned by [SIG Testing][sig-testing], and the people most directly
involved are listed in [/OWNERS]. We are most responsive on our slack channel.

- Community Site: [kubernetes/community/sig-testing][sig-testing]
- Slack: [#sig-testing]
- Mailing List: [kubernetes-sig-testing@]

We also have three other slack channels:

- [#testing-ops]: for [prow.k8s.io] and other test-infra ops.
- [#prow]: for discussions related to the use or development of [`prow`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/prow)
- [#hydrophone]: for discussions related to the use or development of [`hydrophone`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/hydrophone)
- [#testgrid]: for discussions related to the use or development of [`testgrid`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/testgrid)

## Workflow

In general we use the same pull request (PR) and review workflow used by the
rest of the Kubernetes project. This means using:

- [the CNCF CLA][cla]
- [code review by reviewers and approvers listed in OWNERS files][owners]
- tests that automatically exercise code or enforce conventions
  - More recommendations on testing at [contributing-testing] and [testing.md]

Many PRs will result in changes automatically being deployed.

Some conventions that are specific to this repo:

- For large code changes, please write a design doc or [KEP] and get signoff
  from SIG Testing before trying to land code. If you're not sure what a KEP
  should look like, [kuberenetes/enhancements/keps/sig-testing] has some
  examples. If you're not sure what "large" means, [come ask us](#contact)
- We find it polite to apply the `do-not-merge/hold` label via the `/hold`
  command when in doubt about whether/when a PR should merge. If we don't
  explain why we're adding a `/hold`, this is usually because the PR will
  cause changes to be deployed on merge, and we want the person responsible
  for deploying and monitoring the changes to decide when to `/hold cancel`.
  In some cases this is the PR author, in other cases this may be whomever
  is on-call for prow.k8.io.  If you are unsure which, please ask.
- Use of the [`/cc @person`][command-cc] or [`/assign @person`][command-assign]
  commands is the most effective way to put PRs on our radar. You can also
  [contact us](#contact) on Slack.

## Issue Triage

Issues are ideally labeled with:

- milestone: during which release cycle do we plan on working on this issue
- `sig/foo`: which SIG owns this work
- `area/foo`: which subproject or code is this issue related to
- `kind/foo`: which kind of work is this issue describing
- `priority/foo`: how important is this issue

For example, an issue related to cleaning up and consolidating (`kind/cleanup`)
release-related (`sig/release`) jobs and dashboards (`area/config`) for the
v1.16 cycle (`milestone: v1.16`) that may not get completed by the end of the
cycle if more important or more urgent arises (`priority/important-longterm`).

We try to have a non-stale pool of issues that are available for new
contributors who want to help out but aren't sure what to work on or where to
get started:

- [`label:"good first issue"`][good-first-issue] - triaged per [Good First Issue docs][good-first-issue-docs]
- [`label:"help wanted"`][help-wanted] - triaged per [Help Wanted docs][help-wanted-docs]

## Guides

If you're not sure where to contribute or what any of these mean, please see
[/README.md] for a brief description of the various codebases in this repo.

### Build and Test

We use make rules to build, test and deploy code in this repo. In most
cases you can get by just fine with:

```
make test
```

### Dependency Management

Please see [/docs/dep.md]

### Prow Jobs

The majority of the Kubernetes project is tested via prowjobs that run on
[prow.k8s.io]. See [/config/jobs/README.md] for more information.

### TestGrid Config

Test results generated by our prow jobs are available at [testgrid.k8s.io].
To learn more about how to configure which test results display where, see
[/testgrid/README.md]

### GitHub Labels

[go.k8s.io/github-labels] describes GitHub labels that are synced across all
Kubernetes orgs and repos. To update these, please see [/label_sync/README.md]

### External Test Results

We welcome contribution of e2e test results for [kubernetes/kubernetes]
generated by other CI systems on other platforms to ensure that Kubernetes
has test coverage in a variety of environments. For more info please see
[/docs/contributing-test-results.md]
