# This Dockerfile uses multi-stage builds. The first stage builds Triage and gathers the Google
# Cloud SDK, and the resulting files are then used in the second stage.

# Stage 1
FROM golang:1.24 AS build

# Install the Google Cloud SDK
RUN curl -o installer https://sdk.cloud.google.com \
    && bash installer --disable-prompts --install-dir=/ \
    && rm installer

# Build Triage
COPY . /test-infra/triage
WORKDIR /test-infra/triage
RUN env GOOS=linux \
         CGO_ENABLED=0 \
         GO111MODULE=on \
         GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org \
         GOSUMDB=sum.golang.org \
         go build -v -o triage ./main.go


# Stage 2
FROM alpine:3.15.6

# Google Cloud SDK requires python 3.9+ (https://cloud.google.com/python/setup#installing_the_cloud_sdk).
# update_summaries.sh requires bash.
RUN apk add --no-cache \
    python3 \
    bash

# Copy the Google Cloud SDK and link the binaries
COPY --from=build /google-cloud-sdk/ /google-cloud-sdk/
RUN ln -s /google-cloud-sdk/bin/* /bin/

# Copy over the triage binary and shell script that orchestrates everything
COPY --from=build /test-infra/triage/triage /
COPY --from=build /test-infra/triage/update_summaries.sh /

ENTRYPOINT ["timeout", "10800", "/update_summaries.sh"]
