  #  Periodic CI job for running snyk scans against k/k master
  # - It installs snyk CLI and requires 'snyk-token' secret available
  #   in test infra with key name 'SNYK_TOKEN'. This secret is used to
  #   populate env var 'SNYK_TOKEN', required for snyk CLI auth.
  # - Licenses and few false positive deps (eg version '0.0.0') are
  #   filtered from the snyk scan results.
