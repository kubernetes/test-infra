# In most cases, that is sufficient. But in some cases, we are missing some DLLs.
# We can fetch those DLLs from Windows servercore images, but they are very large
# (2GB compressed), while the DLLs are only a few megabytes in size. We can build
# a monthly DLL cache image and use the cache instead.
