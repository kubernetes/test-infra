# Canary images are used by some Prow jobs to ensure that the upcoming releases
# of the sidecars work together. We don't promote those canary images.
# To avoid getting them evicted from the staging area, we have to rebuild
# them periodically. One additional benefit is that build errors show up
# in the sig-storage-image-build *before* tagging a release.
#
# Periodic jobs are currently only specified for the "master" branch
# which produces the "canary" images. While other branches
# could produce release-x.y-canary images, we don't use those.
