# Prow chart 

This is a helm chart for the kubernetes [test-infra prow project](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow).  Prow is the internal CI system/workflow engine used for public kubernetes projects.  This is an attempt to the tool for use for other github projects.  Prow was written to run in it's own kubernetes cluster.

## Usage

###github auth tokens

One goal of this chart was to minimize the manual steps around github auth tokens and webhooks.  It uses a [tool](https://github.com/jfelten) and scripts to genreate and install a github auth token as a secret in the kubernetes cluster.  The webhooks it uses are generated by a helm a pre-install hook and removed by a helm post-install hook upon deletion.

First generate a github user token and add it as a secret to the cluster:

```bash
./generate_auth_k8s.sh
Enter GitHub username: samsungbot
samsungbot's GitHub Password:
wrote results to file: github_cred
GITHUB_AUTH_ID=99013573
GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=<TOKEN_VALUE>
secret "hookmanager-cred" deleted
secret "hookmanager-cred" created
```

Install the helm chart from the stable repo

```bash
helm repo add stable http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-charts-incubator
helm install stable/prow --set repos={"github_org/repo1" "github_org/repo2" ...}
```
